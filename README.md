# EngineYardContest
My entry into Engine Yard's programming contest from a several years ago.

Full details are available from the contest site: http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/programming-contest-win-iphone-3gs-2k-cloud-credit/ but the overall gist was that you wanted to be able to generate a sequence of words that came close to the SHA hash of a list they provided.

I forget where I ultimately ranked, but I lost big time. Still, it was fun. I tried an approach in C and then while that cranked away, I decided "why not Python?". The Python code was way more efficient than the C one was.

But...the C code had a much better Windows Icon.
